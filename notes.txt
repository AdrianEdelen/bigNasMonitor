I don' think this info is available via netdata, but qBittorrnt should have its own API 
    total Upload
    total download
    info about current top N torrents
        Upload


overall there are 2 main apis to interact with
netdata
QBittorrent

additionally there is some info that I am not sure is available from netData (disk health)
