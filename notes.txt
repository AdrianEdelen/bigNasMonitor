API endpoints/ data to get from netdata

header
    Hostname / img
    total disks and active/not active - something like a green dot for active, gray for inactive
    disk health (smart stats maybe or something else, not sure)
    total bandwitch upload/download (should be able to get this from netdata)

Running docker containers 
    sorted by usage (either ram or cpu not sure yet)
    Cpu Usage
    Mem Usage
    Alarms/messages from containers

Disks
    sorted by type, first cache, then regular disks, then, parity
    Reads
    Writes
    Available Space

CPU cores
    package temp maybe with a nice chart.js or something
    Usage
    Temp

QBittorrent stats
I don' think this info is available via netdata, but qBittorrnt should have its own API 
    total Upload
    total download
    info about current top N torrents
        Upload


overall there are 2 main apis to interact with
netdata
QBittorrent

additionally there is some info that I am not sure is available from netData (disk health)


info will be updated on a time basis (1 sec or 5 seconds or something)
in that time, get all the new info, and prepare it for updating

update all parameters at once (unless its better to just update stuff as it happens.)

things that I think can be abstracted/genericized -
netdata api call - these should all be very similar, same root.
building of html for dockers - all of these are the same format
disks - same as the dockers (though there may be special cases for the cache and parity)

main Goal - figure out how the promise/event loop of js works and do it right.
